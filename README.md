# ðŸ’Ž Rails 8 Quickstart ðŸš€

### Get started building Rails 8 apps faster than ever with this new tool

##### What it gives you out of the box

- User accounts with usernames, avatar, profile page | authentication and registration
- Navbar with user dropdown
- Stripe integration for collecting payments


##### What does it cost?

Its free and open source


##### Why did I build it?

Because I haven't found any simple quickstart templates that work well with the basics and defaults of Rails 8.

I wanted a simple quickstart template that would save me the hours of time spent on new projects just to configure them with these basic features every app needed.

## How to use it?

```ruby
rails new my-app -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indigotechtutorials/Rails-8-Quickstart/refs/heads/main/start.rb
```
